 The “T3 Stack” is a web development stack made by  [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) focused on simplicity, modularity, and full-stack typesafety.

The core pieces are Next.js↗ and TypeScript↗. Tailwind CSS↗ is almost always included. If you’re doing anything resembling backend, tRPC↗, Prisma↗, and NextAuth.js↗ are great additions too.

## Behind Learning T3 Stack

This project is a simple blog application that uses the T3 Stack. It is a simple blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts. It also has authentication and authorization features. I personally created this project to learn more about the T3 Stack  and the current company I work for is using the T3 Stack as ther 
main stack.
